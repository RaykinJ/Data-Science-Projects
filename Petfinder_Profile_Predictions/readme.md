The main goal of this project is to attempt to solve the problem of overcrowding in animal shelters by developing a model to determine which factors make animals more likely to get adopted.

Data from PetFinder.com will be analyzed to determine how an animalâ€™s PetFinder profile affects the rates at which animals get adopted. The dataset was obtained from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/c/petfinder-adoption-prediction/data). 

This solution can be used by animal shelters to help animals get adopted faster. This study focuses on photos and animal descriptions, which are features that can be directly altered by shelters to increase adoptability.

Methods used in this project: random forest, xgboost, PCA, CNNs, transfer learning, wide and deep learning
