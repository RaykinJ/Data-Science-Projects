Porsche Clean Air Hackathon Submission

Submission for ATLytiCS Data for Hope: Assessing Environmental Impact, directed by Porsche

Phase 1 involved developing a Proposed Approach, while Phase 2 involved developing a solution given a Porsche identified dataset.

The goal of this project was to identify the typical electrical vehicle consumer. Data was obtained from the the 2017 National Household Travel Survey. In this study, we chose to focus on sex, age, family income, number of children, eduacation, race, home ownership, household size, number of household vehicles,  number of workers in the household, and household's urban area classification. This solution can help Porsche identify potential consumers. 

Methods used in this project: random forest and xgboost.
